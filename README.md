#UFO Sightings Analysis
This project analyzes data on reported UFO sightings to identify patterns and trends.

Project Description:
This project uses data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) to investigate UFO sightings.

The analysis focuses on three aspects:
Locations with UFO sightings: Identify countries with the most reported sightings.
Months with UFO sightings: Investigate if sightings vary throughout the year.
Time periods with UFO sightings: Analyze if sightings happen more frequently at specific times of the day.
The analysis utilizes Python libraries like Matplotlib to visualize the data with bar charts.

Data:
The data for this project is from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).
Note: Since the data source is self-reported, accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
